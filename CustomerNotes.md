## Sprint 1

### Insights:

Customer clicked options right away at the start, customer probably wants to learn more about the game before playing and thinks that instructions might be in options, that could be a good link for tutorial but at the every least solidifies our belief in adding a tutorial pane which host instructions for the game.

Customer was pleased with the visual and color theme, game layout.

Customer wants better text alignments.

### Customer Feedback:

1)Better position the texts within the buttons which includes the titles and panel names in the game pane to ensure that they are in the center.

2)Adding tutorial pane and instructions to better inform the player of the rules and objectives of the game.

3)Speed up the time for the sprints within the game. Currently the time is same as in real time and moves too slow for the game's intentions, thus requiring speed up. 

4)Add colors or symbols to add variation to the text to make it more appealing and intuitive, improving readability.
## Sprint 2

### Insights:

Customer once again clicked on the tutorial button to begin with.

Customer was impressed with the new features that were given in relation to the character relations and their objectives.

Customer had overwhelmingly positive feedback on the new game interactions and the added game over pane.

### Customer Feedback:

1)Customer believed that the buttons on the game pane were not very clearly shown to be interactive buttons. Recommended that we should possibly change the look of those buttons in order to make its usability more clear to the player.

2)Some of the word placement was not properly aligned.  

3)The feature to turn off the sound effect did not completely work. This is something we should fix up in order to complete the functionability of the turn off button for sound effects.

4)Modify the Day and Time features within the game. We would have to change the way the scrum weeks and days update throughout the game. 
## Sprint 3

### Insights:

Customer is not familiar with the game and went to play game button first this time. He interacted with the teammate and is interested in what kind of interactability there are. We thought that that it is indication of the next important thing which is the interactables. We will be implementing them this next sprint along with what was left.

### Customer Feedback:

1) When the timer runs out, the return button will not work after transitioning into the gameover pane as the GAME OVER pop up will prevent returning to the game.

2) The score should be updating with more complexity

3) Add progress bar on teammate for display of efficiency
## Sprint 4

### Insights:

Customer immediately went to the game pane. He immediately got intrigued by the team mate progress bar and wanted to learn more about it. After some time of watching the progress bar he learned exactly what the progress bar did and how it changed depending on game circumstances. This was a great sign that he quickly understood what the bar did, but it did let us know that we may want to make it much more clearer for the players. We will do this by updating the tutorial pane in order to quickly inform the player on the progress bar and its purpose.

### Customer Feedback
1) Make the purpose of the progress bar to users but adding it to the tutorial pane.

2) Give functionality to the velocity feauture in the game.

3) Center "Game over" button in the game pane.
